# FriendFinder

This short, 10-question quiz will match you with a friend who most closely shares your interests. After completing the quiz, a modal will pop up with your new friend's name and picture.

# How It Works
The user's answers are added up to generate the user's score, which is compared with the scores of all other friend objects in our friends.js file. The Express POST/GET functions compare the user with our existing friend set and post the matching friend in a result modal. The user's information is stored for future quiz-takers.
